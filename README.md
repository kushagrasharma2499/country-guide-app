# country-guide-app

we have three files index.html, style.css and script.js. They are the HTML document, the stylesheet and the script file.

We begin with HTML code. Firstly copy the code below and paste it into your HTML document. This creates the structure of our app.

Next, we need to style these elements to make the project look sleek and beautiful. In order to do so, we use CSS. Now copy the code provided to you below and paste it into your CSS file.

Finally, we need to implement the functionality to make this app work. For that, we make use of javascript. Now copy the code below and paste it into your script file.
